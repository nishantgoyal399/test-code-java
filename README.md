## Command to Generate Documentation via Javadoc Tool 🛠️

- To generate documentation in the same folder as the source file:

```console
javadoc SourceFileName.java
```

- To generate documentation in a different folder:

```console
javadoc -d "Output Folder Path" SourceFileName.java
```

- For example, in this project, after navigating to the project root, the following command was executed:

```console
javadoc -d "docs" src\com\kapil\javadocdemo\JavadocDemo.java
```

## How to View the Documentation? 🌐

- The generated documentation files are located in the folder: <strong>docs/</strong>

- Open <strong>docs/index.html</strong> in any web browser to view the documentation.

---

## Notes 📝

- Ensure the Javadoc tool is installed and accessible via your system's PATH.

- Replace <strong>SourceFileName.java</strong> with the actual Java source file you want to document.
